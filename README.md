Coded within eclipse; uses the SWT library for graphical support.

# How to build
1. Import the project into eclipse and create a java application run 
   configuration on src/main/java/sierpinski/Main
2. Build on the command line using the following command:

# How to run
[I assume you have Java-8 installed on your system somewhere...]

Run using the following command:

    java -jar target/sierpinski-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
 
For your convenience I've uploaded a copy of the prebuilt jar file 
to this archive under target/. If you download it in Windows (at
least) then double-clicking on the Jar may start the application
directly if you are lucky...
